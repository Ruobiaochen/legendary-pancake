Overall important idea:
coordinate free formulas
parametrization free formulas
moving frame representation/diff equation (local intrinsic invariant)
simplification by reparametrization

Keys in 3-d smooth curve theory:
Frenet frame & F-S formula
configuration space is curvature & torsion

Keys in 3-d smooth surface theory:
Intrinsic quantity: Gauss curvature
Gauss map and its derivative: W transformation, ie. shape operator
orthogonal parametrization, isothermal parametrization
motion equation and its integrable condition(Gauss-Codazzi)
configuration space is two fundamental forms which satisfy Gauss-Codazzi
