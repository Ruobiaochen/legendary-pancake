//gradient and directional derivative:consider the tangent space at the point
//2 variable:integrate "along" gradients using small plane instead of short line as in one variable.
//partial derivative:fix other variables and integrate as if in one variable.

linear operator.
remark.variable coefficient equation can't be reduced to a change of coordinate between partial derivatives(thus the change of x,y,z,...) because this will induce to solve a similar equation.
