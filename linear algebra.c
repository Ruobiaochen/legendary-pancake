//Similarity
Frobenius normal form(rational canonical form):maximal decomposition into cyclic(stable) subspace
generalized Jordan normal form(primary rational canonical form):minimal decomposition
Smith normal form of the eigenmatrix corresponds to normal forms of the original matrix.

//Quadratic form,inner product,bilinear form(and sesquilinear form),dual space
quadratic form corresponds to symmetric matrix.
norm can induce inner product. that is,the form XtQX and XtQY can express each other.
a (nondegenerate) bilinear form corresponds to an isomorphism between V and V*.(cf. bilinear mapping)


//Inner product space
