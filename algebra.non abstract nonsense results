1.Baer's criterion for injective modules
R is integral domain, K=frac R, then K is injective R-module.
R is PID, M is divisible R-mod, then M is injective.

2.Chinese Remainder Theorem

3.M is free R-mod, then M/IM is free R/I-mod.

4.structure theorems for f.g. PID-mod
proj=free PID-mod
flat=torsion free PID-mod
sub mod of f.g. free PID-mod is free

5.Hilbert basis theorem

6.R is Artin ring, then the set of maximal ideals of R is finite

7.(non-)correspondence for ideals of localization
