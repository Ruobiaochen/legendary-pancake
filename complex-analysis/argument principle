Statement1
int f'(z)/f(z)=2pi*i*N,where N is the number of zeroes(count multiplicity) in the contour.

Step1
wlog,assume 0 is m-th zero of f.

Step2
By Taylor expansion,f(z)=z^m*g(z) and g(0)!=0.

Step3
Integrate f'(z)/f(z) around a small enough contour around 0 where g!=0 in this circle,which is promised by continuity.

Statement2
int f'(z)/f(z)=change of i*arg(f) when z goes 1 circle around z0

Step1
int f'(z)/f(z)=int d(ln(f))=change of ln(f(z)) when z goes 1 circle around z0

Step2
change of ln(f(z))=change of i*arg(f)
