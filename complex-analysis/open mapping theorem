Step1
Choose an appropriate circle C around z,choose another appropriate circle B around f(z).
We want to show that interior B is contained in the set f(interior C),so if y is in Int B,we want to show it can be mapped from Int C,which means there exists zero of (f-y) inside C.

Step2
This now becomes an immediate consequence of "invariance of zeroes".
