Step1
Choose an appropriate circle C around z,choose another appropriate circle B around f(z).
We want to show that interior B is contained in the set f(interior C),so if y is in Int B,we want to show it can be mapped from Int C,which means there exists zero of (f-y) inside C.

Step2
We know that zero inside C can be reduced to some consideration of the boundary.
In particular,Rouche theorem,that is,an inequality on C,gives us that information.
