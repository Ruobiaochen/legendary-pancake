main object:f:C->C(holomorphic,entire,meromorphic)

fundamental lemma
Cauchy theorem
Cauchy integral formula for coefficients of Laurent series(which themselves are derivatives and integrals of the center of series)
in an annulus,holomorphic is equivalent to analytic(in the sense of Laurent)

connection of topics below
pole is dual to zero.
function with only one singularity on Riemann sphere is equal to entire function.(for example through MÃ¶bius transform)

estimation
Cauchy inequality
Schwarz lemma

fiber (ie. zero)
lemma.relationship between factorization and derivative and series
isolated zero theorem
lemma.analytic(in the sense of opposite to topological) representation of winding number
argument principle(count zero and pole)
Rouche theorem(symmetric version)
local invariant of zero number
Hurwitz theorem for function limit invariant of zero number

isolated singularity
lemma.removable singularity iff bounded
Picard great theorem
sum of all residue is zero.

open mapping theorem

injective implies non-vanishing derivative implies biholomorphic

maximum modulus principle
