//For Kalman filter.

random variable: a measurable function X:O->E,where O is a probability space,E a measurable space.
remark.it's a function from o in O (outcome) to something depend on it.
probability space: a triple {O,F,P}
remark. O is sample space (outcomes),F is event sets,P is measure.
expected value: E[g(x)],abbreviated to Eg(x).
discrete random(stochastic) process: a sequence of random variables x(t).
realization(sample function) of the process:theta(t),which is one particular set of observed values of x(t).
uncorrelated (of a single random process): t!=s -> Ex(t)x(s)=Ex(t)Ex(s)
remark.meaning of E[xy]:http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/656612/what-does-exy-mean
orthogonal (of a single random process): t!=s -> Ex(t)x(s)=Ex(t)Ex(s)=0
remark.any uncorrelated can be turn into orthogonal.
covariance: cov(x,y)=Exy-ExEy.
conditional probability,expectation.
gaussian(normally distributed) random variable.
