//As with the (locally) approximation by linear map,here C->C is approached by y(z)=az,which means amplifying and rotating.
//duality:conjugate
//take care of a complex number equals zero:re part and im part both zero.
//Euler formula.The first insight comes from consider df/dz at z=0.(we want to go up in the im axis.)from this we can see in order to further the extension,we need to know some other information,such that df/dz=f at non-real z.
//now we change the perspective that exp should satisfy f(x+y)=f(x)f(y).in fact we can infer from this that f will satisfy the previous condition,and we've done.(i know two ways:1.calculate df/dz just use definition of derivative.(amazingly,from baiduzhidao!) 2.take log and it's converted to Cauchy's functional equation.)

//ch1.preliminary
Arg is a set,Arg0 is undefined,arg is between (-pi,pi].
point at infinity:one point compactification.
Riemann sphere.
//remark.this can remove some kind of singularities by set them to the infinity point.
