//As with the (locally) approximation by linear map,here C->C is approached by y(z)=az,which means amplifying and rotating.
//duality:conjugate
//take care of a complex number equals zero:re part and im part both zero.

//ch1.preliminary
Arg is a set,Arg0 is undefined,arg is between (-pi,pi].
point at infinity:one point compactification.
Riemann sphere.
//remark.this can remove some kind of singularities by set them to the infinity point.
