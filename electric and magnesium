Magnetic south is geometric north.
Idl produces B.
B exerts force on Idl.
evenly B: F=0 M=uB,u=IS
unevenly B: F=(u.del)B
B field
The Lorentz force on a particle doesn't change the magnitude of its velocity.
Hall effect
magnetic moment
magnetizing intensity M:magnetic moment per volume

H=B/u0-M
magnetizing rate:X=M/H
