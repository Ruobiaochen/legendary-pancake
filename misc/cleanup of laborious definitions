Fundamental group
pi(X,x_0) is L/~, where L is all loops at x_0 and ~ is homotopy
f_* is Hom((X,x_0)->(Y,y_0))->Hom(pi(...)->pi(...))

Smooth manifolds
n-dimensional smooth manifold is (M,S) where M is a n-dimensional topological manifold, S is a smooth structure
smooth structure is an equivalent class of atlas
atlas is a collection of charts (which cover M and the transition maps are smooth)
chart is (phi,U,V)
smooth function is f: M->R
smooth map is f: M->N
smooth map f is a diffeomorphism: f is smooth, bijective, f^(-1) is smooth
C^inf(M): (M*) all smooth functions on M
tangent vector is X_p: C^inf(M)->R satisfying Leibnitz rule
tangent space TpM (M**) is the set of all tangent vectors at p
differential of a smooth map f is (M->N lifts to M**->N**) dfp: TpM->T(fp)N
（注意到M具有向量空间的结构时，由M到M**的自然嵌入，tangent vector就真的是一个（M中的）vector）
regular value: q is regular value if for all p in f-1(q), f is submersion at p.
