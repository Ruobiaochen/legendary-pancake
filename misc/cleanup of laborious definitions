Fundamental group
pi(X,x_0) is L/~, where L is all loops at x_0 and ~ is homotopy
f_* is Hom((X,x_0)->(Y,y_0))->Hom(pi(...)->pi(...))

Smooth manifolds
n-dimensional smooth manifold is (M,S) where M is a n-dimensional topological manifold, S is a smooth structure
smooth structure is an equivalent class of atlas
atlas is a collection of charts (which cover M and the transition maps are smooth)
chart is (phi,U,V)
smooth function is f: M->R
smooth map is f: M->N
smooth map f is a diffeomorphism: f is smooth, bijective, f^(-1) is smooth
