metric space: there is a need to describe different mode of convergence, and metric space with different metric function can induce different topology, which does the work.
complete: this is a condition in Banach fixed point theorem.
relatively compact: condition in Arzela-Ascoli theorem


regular (curve): condition so that arc parameter is well-defined
signed (curvature on plane): since in the plane two vectors are enough to define an orientation, so we can define the normal vector to keep the orientation as right-handed.


topology space structure (ie. specification of open subsets): to describe such concepts as continuity, connectedness.
