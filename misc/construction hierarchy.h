0.1 (in Rn) closed and bounded is compact
0.2 (in R) closed and bounded set in R always has a minimum

1.1 (in topological space) f: compact M->R can attain its minimum (0.2)

1i.1 smoothly zero function: R->R, 0 when x<0, else e^(-1/x).

2i.1 smooth transition function: R->R, \cite(1i.1) as h, h(x)/(h(x)+h(1-x)).

3i.1 bump function: Rn->R, \cite(2i.1) as g, g(2-|x|).

4i.1 bump function: manifold M->R, \cite(3i.1) as p, \cite(2i.1) as q, q(sigma(p_i(phi_i)))
