interval subset of A:subset of set A in R,in the form of the union of finitely many disjoint subintervals A1,..,An(n is not fixed)
absolutely continuous:f:[a,b]->R,st. inf_d sup_(E=interval subset of [a,b],st.m(E)<d) sigma(|f(bk)-f(ak)|) = 0,where ak and bk are endpoints of subintervals in E
Cantor-Lebesgue function:a map from Cantor set to [0,1]. Can also be extended to [0,1]->[0,1].
bounded variation:f:[a,b]->R,st. sup_(E=interval subset of [a,b]) sigma(|f(bk)-f(ak)|) < +inf,where ak and bk are endpoints of subintervals in E
